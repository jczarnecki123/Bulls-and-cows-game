Here are rules of the game:
A 4-digit number is generated. The digits must be all different. Then, the player tries to guess the secret number and the output gives the number of matches. If the matching digits are in their right positions, they are "bulls", if in different positions, they are "cows". Example:

Secret number: 4271
Opponent's try: 1234
Answer: 1 bull and 2 cows. (The bull is "2", the cows are "4" and "1".)
